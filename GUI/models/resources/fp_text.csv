EX_R;Exocanthion R;The point at the outer commissure of the eye where the outer margin of the upper eyelid meets the lower eyelid. If the precise spot cannot be found then the location is in the intersection of imaginary lines obtained by prolonging the eyelid margins. The point is bilateral.
EX_L;Exocanthion L;The point at the outer commissure of the eye where the outer margin of the upper eyelid meets the lower eyelid. If the precise spot cannot be found then the location is in the intersection of imaginary lines obtained by prolonging the eyelid margins. The point is bilateral.
EN_R;Endocanthion R;The point at the inner commissure of the eye where the inner margin of the upper eyelid meets the lower eyelid. It is the most medial point at the lacrimal caruncle. In case a skin fold is present (epicanthus, plica mongolica, plica marginalis fetis) and the point is not visible, by Kolar and Salter’s recommendations (1997) the landmark is defined as the point where the fold crosses the lower eyelid. In this case the points are not homologous. The point is bilateral.

PAS_R;Palpebra superior R;The point which is located at the intersection of a line going through the eye center (parallel to the mid-sagittal plane) and the caudal (lower) margin of the upper eyelid. The eye center is defined as the half distance between exocanthion and endocanthion. Together with the palpebra inferior point the landmark determines the eye height. The point is bilateral.

N;Nasion;The point in the midline on the nasal root, the deepest point of the nasal root.
PRN;Pronasale;The most anterior midline point of the nasal tip with the head positioned in the Frankfurt horizontal plane. If the nasal tip is bifid the point is located in the mid-sagittal plane between the elevations.
LS;Labrale superius;The midpoint of the upper vermilion line. From lateral view this point is mostly covered by other parts of the lips. In case of bow-shaped upper vermilion the point is located in the mid-distance between cheilion points. (by Farkas 1994, modified)

CP_R;Crista philtri R;The point located at the place where the line, which is going through the highest margins of the upper vermilion, meets the lower margin of crista philtri. The point is bilateral.
CP_L;Crista philtri L;The point located at the place where the line, which is going through the highest margins of the upper vermilion, meets the lower margin of crista philtri. The point is bilateral.
SL;Sublabiale;The midpoint of the mentolabial sulcus (the ridge between the chin and the lower lip, not the vermilion). The point is located at the flexion point of the concavity.
