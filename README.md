# Fidentis
Fidentis Analysist a target-orientated user-friendly computer interface for processing 3D meshes of human faces. The program enables a variety of 3D facial morphological analyses designed for forensic purposes, such as 3D facial composite construction, automated landmark localization, face-to-face comparison and analysis of facial morphological variation via batch processing. 

FIDENTIS is a software tool for forensic 3D facial identification, http://fidentis.cz .

This project is being developed at Masaryk University, Brno as collaborative project between Human Computer Interaction Laboratory at Faculty of Informatics and Department of Anthropology at Faculty of Science.
